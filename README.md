# ⚠️⚠️⚠️DEPRECATED⚠️⚠️⚠️

This LIFF Starter App is designed only for LIFF v1, which is already discontinued.    
From now on, please check [the latest version of LIFF Starter App](https://github.com/line/line-liff-v2-starter) instead.

# LIFF Starter App

This is a small web application that demonstrates the basic functionality of the [LINE Front-end Framework (LIFF)](https://developers.line.me/en/docs/liff/overview/). 

## Prerequisites
* [A channel on the LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.me/en/docs/liff/getting-started/) for your application.
* [A channel access token](https://developers.line.me/en/docs/liff/getting-started/#preparing-channel-access-token)
* A [Heroku account](https://www.heroku.com)

## Deploying the application

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/line/line-liff-starter)

1. Click the above "Deploy to Heroku button".
2. Fill in the required information on the "Create a New App" page in Heroku.
3. Select Deploy app and confirm that your app is successfully deployed.

## Adding the starter app to LIFF

Add the app to LIFF. For more information, see [Adding a LIFF app](https://developers.line.me/en/docs/liff/registering-liff-apps/).

## Running the application

3. Open your LIFF in the LINE app.


## Trying it out

To open the LIFF app within the LINE app, follow the steps below.

1. Tap `line://app/{liffId}` on the chat screen of the LINE app. `{liffId}` is the LIFF app ID returned to the API request to add the app to LIFF.

2. Agree to grant the required permissions to the LIFF app.

3. When opening the LIFF app, the following four buttons and the content of received information are displayed.

    - Open Window: Opens `https://line.me` in the in-app browser of the LINE app.
    - Close Window: Closes the LIFF app.
    - Get Access Token: Gets the current user's access token.
    - Get Profile: Gets the current user's profile.
    - Send Messages: Sends a sample message on behalf of the user if the LIFF app is opened in the chat screen.


For API calls associated with the buttons, see [Calling the LIFF API](https://developers.line.me/en/docs/liff/developing-liff-apps#calling-liff-api). For the received information, see [Initializing the LIFF app](https://developers.line.me/en/docs/liff/developing-liff-apps#initializing-liff-app).
